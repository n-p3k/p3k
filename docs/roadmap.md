# PC3 Roadmap

## In-Progress:
- [ ] frame transformation: from loaded object space to world space (256x256x256)
- [ ] xray blending as layer shared across effects and graph nodes
- [x] theme: add 'dark-to-bright' dark gray-to-white color mapping theme

## Observer: Frustrum, Space, CFs, Graph Tools
Enable diverse coexistence with CPU, GPU, inter-network, inter-process parts

- [ ] cpu rendering
- [ ] perspective generator
- [ ] cf: coordinate frame selector
- [ ] data source polling
- [ ] config editor
- [ ] graph editor

## Engine Graph

- [ ] graph pipeline composition
- [ ] graph visualization (pyflow)
- [ ] config and state machine management


## Coordinate Frames
- [ ] CFs facilitation


## Tooling & Visualization
- [ ] visualization: loading mesh as observation volume
- [ ] tool: space renderer (cpu)
- [ ] probe: inter-process data sharing with uri 'mem://topic'
- [ ] transformer: basis alignment between reference and time-lapsed frames
- [ ] visualization: volume filling by penetration
- [ ] transformer: volume shaping by screen pixel picking
- [ ] visualization: point cloud transparency
- [ ] transformer: volume shaping by surface shifting
- [ ] probe: interactive data sharing with clipboard ('clip://topic')
- [ ] probe: interactive data sharing with screenshot, mouse ('screen://topic')
- [ ] gui: imgui options and menus for parametrization
- [ ] visualization: light probe
- [ ] visualization: reflection probe
- [ ] visualization: depth probe
- [ ] visualization: occlusion detection
- [ ] automaton: event trigger
- [ ] engine: graph architecture and graph editing
- [ ] visualization: x-ray vision
